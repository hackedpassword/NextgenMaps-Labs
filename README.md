# Update
Current version of Castles is no longer compatible with The Great Unciv Rework. I'll need to make a couple updates to fix this.

# Castles v7, mod: The Great Unciv Rework

- Size: Large
- Design Objective: Medieval country side, populated
- Desired feedback: Microstories of various locales that are either absent or obviously in need of improvement. Gameplay derives from microstories.

## Overview

Unciv resources have very limited variety in terms of terrain, resources, improvements, etc. The Castles map incorporates "microstories" throughout the map. These microstories are told in the simplest ways possible by mixing and matching game elements to provide fuzzy soft interpretation of /what might/ be happening here or there.

There's adventure here. I get a bit of old school rpg nostalgia in this map. These microstories may contribute to a larger tale, a grander scope of the land. So much could be said, in just a few well-considered tiles.

## Mod - ruleset
I chose The Great Unciv Rework as I felt the nuace changes from standard Unciv best applied here. If the player so desires go Vanilla or G&K, Castles will function with only slight variation.
