# Castles v5, mod: The Great Unciv Rework

- Size: Large
- Design Objective: Medieval country side, populated
- Desired feedback: Microstories of various locales that are either absent or obviously in need of improvement. Gameplay derives from microstories.

## Overview

Some areas are meant to be spacious and vast. Others are blank canvases. Unciv resources are very limited in terms of laying down terrain, resources, improvements, etc, so microstories are told in the simplest ways possible. Mixing and matching these elements provide fuzzy soft interpretation of /what might/ be happening here or there.

There's adventure here. I get a bit of old school rpg nostalgia in this map. These microstories may contribute to a larger tale, a grander scope of the land. So much could be said, in just a few well-considered tiles.

## Mod - ruleset
I chose The Great Unciv Rework as I felt the nuace changes from standard Unciv best applied here. If the player so desires go Vanilla or G&K, it'll hold with only slight variation.

## Don't be scrd!
I'm continually updating this map, though since you see it here, taking input and feedback on what you thought would be an interesting addition. I can merge or replace elements already placed if your feedback is more interesting than my placements.
